#Geometry
One of the most important aspects of game development is geometry. As you have seen in the **TileBasedGames** tutorial a game might render comlicated graphics, but the underlying logic is simplyfied into primitive shapes.

Before going any further, we're going to learn a bit more about common primitives and how they interact. Specifically we're going to write some code for: Line Segments, Lines, Rays, Circles, Rectangles and Boxes. 

We're not going to be using the built in primitives of C#, instead we will write custom Lines, Rectangles and all ther primitives.

The Geometry we learn in this section is used in a **LOT** of collision detection and physics code. To demonstrate the usefulness of these methods we're going to cover how to properly avoid tunneling at the end of this section!
