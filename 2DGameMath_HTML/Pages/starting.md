#Starting out
By this point you should have ample experience setting up a game project using our 2D framework. If not, the **Tile Based Games** tutorials go trough how to do it.

To follow along with the code in this tutorial, make a new github repository. I suggest calling your repository something along the lines of **GameMath**, **2DMath** or **2DGameMath**. Call it whatever you feel is best.

Set the repository up clean, this means include a gitignore file, and a license. We're only going to have one sln (solution) file, but it's going to have multiple csproj (project) files under it. Just like **TileBasedGames** did. 
Set the solution up too. I suggest making a **BaseWindow** project that just shows an empty window to make sure that your repository structure is good / clean.
